# Samples of Work

## [Revolutsia](https://revolutsia.com)
*PHP, ExpressionEngine, FoundationCSS, Sass*
One of my favorite "new build" projects I've done, this site was built for a local retail space made completely from reclaimed shipping containers. I love how the design turned out, and I had fun adding different hover effects to make the site playful and lively. 

## [The Parts Trading Network](https://partstradingnetwork.com)
*PHP, Laravel, VueJS, InertiaJS, TailwindCSS*
 Although most of the site is private to Bobcat Dealers apart from the [help articles](https://partstradingnetwork.com/articles) that explain some of the site functionality, I am immensely proud of this application. I was responsible not only for building the app from scratch, I also architected the infrastructure and oversaw user support as our user base expanded to nearly 200 dealerships across the US and Canada. Utilizing PHP generator functions and Laravel Queues, it can process dealer-submitted CSV files with millions of lines without exhausting server resources.
